# Yield Curve Simulation App

This is a Streamlit-based web app for simulating and reverse-engineering fixed income yield curves using a pivot tenor and multiple distortion factors.

## Features
- Simulate a yield curve by shifting a pivot point and applying short/long end factors and caps.
- Reverse-engineer simulation parameters from a simulated curve.

## Running locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Deployment
Deploy this app easily on [Streamlit App](https://yieldcurvesimulation-8uwsoblcjwe9d6bdvhvrd4.streamlit.app/).
